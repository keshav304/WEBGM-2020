                There are two sides to all the CS people. On one day we may want to spend all night coding, and on another,
                we may get the urge to spend the night (and a couple of nights more) playing counterstrike! 
                Both these sides need to be catered to. And the Computer science club, Sathyabama university is the organization that does it.
                The CS club takes care of all your computing needs. It conducts technical events like Workshops, hackathons, 
                and talks by world-renowned scientists take place throughout the year which covers everything you could imagine, from 
                web development to cloud computing. Basically we are like your proessors :):)</p>

                Of course, events shouldnâ€™t all be technical, should they? We need to give those brain cells a little rest, 
                and just have a bit of fun! Events like Counterstrike, Treasure Hunt, Number Games, and Tech Quiz ensure that
                the fun doesn't go out of computer science, and give you a chance to showcase your extracurricular talent. 
                we try to make the sessions as interactive as possible with our main objective to improve and enhance the technical skill 
                set of the students.Basically we make your college life fun and memorable :):)
